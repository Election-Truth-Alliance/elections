# North Carolina Data Tutorial

This tutorial will take you through the steps of finding, extracting and cleaning the North Carolina
election data from the 2024 General election in that state and take it to the point where
the data is suitable for extracting analysis in a standard way.

The tutorial is broken into two sections:
- [Sourcing](SOURCING.md) - Defining the type of data to find and how to make sense of it.
- [Cleaning](CLEANING.md) - Taking that data and putting it into a format that is easy to apply our analytics to.
- [Analysis](../analysis/README) - Taking the cleaned data and creating visual analysis of the data.
