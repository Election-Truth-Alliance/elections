# Files

For this tutorial, we have two races:
- [2024 North Carolina General Election for President - Election Day Votes](2024_G_NC_President.xlsx)
- [2024 North Carolina General Election for Attorney General - Election Day Votes](2024_G_NC_Attorney_General.xlsx)

The files contain cleaned data with the following information:
- Precincts
- Registered voters
- Name and votes for candidate 1
- Name and votes for candidate 2
- Total votes cast

This is the basic information needed for the different visualizations to calculate things metrics such as vote share, turnout, etc.
