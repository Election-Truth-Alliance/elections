# Analysis

Once you have a cleaned data source, you can start doing analysis. There are certainly
many different means of analysis. There are many types of analysis available on the
[Election Truth Election Data Dashboard](https://data.electiontruthalliance.org/). This repo will aim to provide scripts
to take the clean data and perform the analysis yourself.

This tutorial has two directories:
- [files](files) - The location of the cleaned election data.
- [scripts](scripts) - Scripts to create visualizations
