# Election Truth Alliance Elections Repository

The Election Truth Alliance is a non-profit, non-partisan organization founded in December of 2024 when multiple individuals came together to share independent data, analysis, and research into the results of the 2024 US Presidential Election. As concerning trends emerged from our shared data we moved quickly, at the speed of trust, to make our findings more accessible and understandable to the broader public.

We are a non-profit corporation and group of passionate volunteers who are committed to making a positive impact in our elections. In particular, we have brought together individuals with data analysis and cyber skills to identify potential manipulation or anomalies. Our aim is to ensure that the public is equipped with vital information about the security, integrity, and legitimacy of their vote.

In today’s landscape of pervasive disinformation, misinformation, and ‘weaponized unreality’, we believe the truth still matters.

Our membership includes volunteers from multiple countries, including the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. We recognize that foreign and domestic election interference is a global challenge, and that we are all made weaker when our interconnected democracies are compromised. While our organization is currently focused on the 2024 US Presidential Election, in the longer-term we plan to broaden our scope.
The ETA is a data-driven organization committed to the principle that every eligible voter has the right to vote and have their vote counted accurately. The organization’s mission is to support transparent, independent audit and advocacy to ensure that election results have been sufficiently audited to safeguard fair and free elections.

Elections are very local events and doing this analysis requires diving down into individual counties 
and precincts and trying to understand how different state laws apply to different results. 

The purpose of this repo is to provide the data and tools to explain and help others reproduce our methods and results.
All data used for analysis is public data provided by the states and counties of the United States. 
We welcome feedback and hope others will take the time to understand potential election security concerns.
